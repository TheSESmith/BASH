# BASH
My Collection Of Bash Related Stuff!

Since I do most of my work at the console, I rely heavily on the capability of bash for time-saving tidbits.

I will start with a pretty heavy .bash_profile setup with numerous functions & custom prompt.

This will be followed up as time permits & need arises.

I build & run FreeBSD & OpenBSD servers, as appropriate, where appropriate.

I Develop on an Ubunto notebook.
